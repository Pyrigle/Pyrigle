# Hello 👋, I am *Pyrigle!*
<sub><i> 🚧 Under construction 🚧 <i><sub>
## About Me:
I am an aspiring security engineer looking to dive into a SOC role. I have 8 years of experience in IT, a bachelors in Cyber Security, and a strong passion for learning. From outside the security field looking in I defintely see myself as someone whom will excel in blue team/SOC. I tend to enjoy combing through log files, event, and configs for any tiny issues that may be causeing trouble.
